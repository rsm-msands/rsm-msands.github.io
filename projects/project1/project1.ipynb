        "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of their project was to test the effectiveness of a matching grant on chartiable giving. Via their large-scale natural field experiment, they found that match offer increases both the charitable revenue per solicitation and the response rate to the letters. However, the larger amount of the match ratio, (i.e. $3:$1 and $2:$1), relative to a smaller match ratio, ($1:$1), had no additional impact on the revenue per solicitation nor the response rate. \n",

        "_to do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the \"middle\" of the distribution or whether it's in the \"tail.\"_\n"
